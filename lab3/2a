#2. Write a program that accepts start and stop as input from users and print if numbers from start to stop are:
a. positive or zero or negative.
start=int(input("Starting range:"))
stop=int(input("Ending range:"))
step=int(input("Step count:"))
for i in range(start,stop+1,step):
    if i > 0:
       print(i,"it is positive number")
    elif i == 0:
       print(i,"it is Zero")
    elif i < 0:
       print(i,"it is a negative number")
       Output:
       Starting range:-6
Ending range:2
Step count:2
-6 it is a negative number
-4 it is a negative number
-2 it is a negative number
0 it is Zero
2 it is positive number
